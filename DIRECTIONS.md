# Description
This website allows users to take, save and check weather data from any city by using the search tool. The user may search for multiple cities and find the 5 day weather forecast for that city with relevant data related to date, temperature, humidity, and wind in that city. The user may also view the current date on a larger screen at the top of the page.

# Known Bugs
- UV data is not included in the API dataset and would require another API to display
- Code should be written to eliminate user bugs when incorrect entries are made in the search section
- More dynamic imagery should be displayed in the 5 day forecast 
- Temperature should be changed to Farenheit
- Need to add save data features for local storage
